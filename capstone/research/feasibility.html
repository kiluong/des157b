                <span class="bold-heading">Features</span> 
                Some features I plan to incorporate in my project are charts, drag and drop, animating on scroll, and a data base to collect data from surveys in realtime and display those as statistics at the end of the website to see how many people have accessed the website. <br>
                
                Some technologies I would need to execute this is the animate on scoll library, interact library, charts library, and connecting the back4app server. <br>

                I have experience using the charts library, the animate on scroll library, and connecting the back4app from previous class assignments and mini-studios. I have not played around with the interact library yet but I plan to learn it for this project and believe it is within scope of learning.
