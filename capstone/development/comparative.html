                <span class="bold-heading">Depop </span> 
                Depop’s interface is minimal and visually driven, reflecting its Gen Z user base. The app balances e-commerce functionality with a social media-like experience, encouraging personal branding and storytelling through curated shop feeds and styling posts. While this makes it engaging, its search and filtering features can be clunky, and the user experience sometimes favors aesthetic over streamlined usability. Nonetheless, Depop promotes individuality, secondhand culture, and peer-to-peer fashion exchange—aligning well with your project's emphasis on personalization and sustainability.

            <p>
                <span class="bold-heading">Grailed</span>
                 Grailed is a curated peer-to-peer marketplace focusing on men's fashion, particularly streetwear, archival, and designer pieces. The interface is minimalist and emphasizes product imagery, with robust filtering by brand, category, and price, which helps users navigate niche or high-end items. Interaction design leans toward serious collectors and fashion enthusiasts, featuring detailed listings and an active comment section for negotiation and discussion. While it lacks the playful social feel of Depop, its focus on authenticity, style knowledge, and community engagement makes it a strong reference for fostering niche fashion culture within a circular economy.<br>
