                Users weren’t sure what to do at first.

                While the overlay instructions helped guide testers, many ignored or quickly dismissed the welcome modal without fully reading it. As a result, several users hesitated before realizing they needed to drag and drop the items onto the avatar.

                Fix: Consider triggering a visual hint (like a pulsing item or animated arrow) to reinforce the drag-and-drop mechanic after the overlay closes. A subtle tooltip on hover could also help. <br>

                The navigation flow feels linear and disconnected.

                Users enjoyed the drop interaction but were confused about what came next. The storytelling—origin > material > checkout—wasn’t clearly linked to the item they interacted with. Once they dropped a shirt, they expected specific info to show up, not generic text that didn’t change.

                Fix: Dynamically update each section based on the item dropped. Tie each product to unique sourcing/material info and maybe change the visuals or highlight relevant sections when an item is placed. <br>

                <span class="bold-heading">Usability Insight 03</span>
                The message came through—but felt disconnected emotionally.

                Most users understood the critique of fast fashion and found the tone effective. However, they said it lacked the emotional punch or storytelling depth to really resonate. The visuals were stylized and fun, but didn’t always match the gravity of the issues described (e.g., poor working conditions or pollution).

                Fix: Introduce human-centered visuals—like blurred silhouettes of workers or microplastic pollution overlays—to bridge the gap between playful aesthetic and serious message. Using transitions like fading in disturbing facts after interaction could build tension more effectively. <br>

                <span class="bold-heading">How can I improve my project?</span>
                Based on the usability feedback, I plan to refine the project by first enhancing the onboarding experience to make the drag-and-drop interaction more intuitive. This includes adding subtle animations or visual cues—such as a pulsing glow around the items or avatar—immediately after the overlay closes, ensuring users understand how to begin. Next, I will make each interaction more meaningful by dynamically updating the content shown based on the item dropped, so users see specific information about that item's origin, materials, and environmental impact. Finally, I will adjust the visual tone of the project to better align with the serious nature of the message. This may include incorporating more emotionally resonant imagery, like stylized silhouettes or environmental overlays, as well as smoother transitions or ambient sound to create a more impactful and immersive experience.
