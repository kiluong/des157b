    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <p> 1.<b> What is your topic and who is the target audience? </b> <br>
        My topic centers on circular fashion and secondhand shopping ecosystems, reimagining the life cycle of clothing through community-driven exchange, upcycling, and reuse. The goal is to shift the cultural narrative away from fast fashion and toward more sustainable, personalized practices. The target audience includes Gen Z thrifters, Depop and Poshmark sellers, fashion designers interested in slow fashion or upcycling, and environmentally conscious consumers who want to reduce their footprint without sacrificing style or creativity.
    </p>
    <p> 2.<b> Identify lenses we have discussed in class that your topic may rely on most </b> <br>
        This project is most rooted in Speculative Design, as it invites users to imagine alternative futures for fashion that challenge the dominant, waste-heavy system. It also draws from Challenging Mental Models, such as confronting the idea that new equals better, or that secondhand clothing is only for people with limited means. Data Visualization plays a key role in making abstract concepts—like environmental impact or social trade networks—concrete and interactive. Utopian/Dystopian narratives frame both the promise of a sustainable future and the risks of continued overconsumption. <br> </p>
    <p> 3.<b>What are some of the features you imagine your project/product would include? </b> <br>
        The main feature would be an interactive story map where users follow the journey of a garment—from its fast fashion origins to potential futures like being thrifted, upcycled, or digitally archived. Along the way, users make choices that influence the garment’s path, earning "eco-points" or social rewards for sustainable behavior. Other features may include a swap-style wishlist, visualizations of local “thrift loops” without shipping, and dynamic data graphs comparing the environmental costs of new vs. secondhand items. </p>
    <p> 4.<b> Are there possible tangents, challenges, concerns, or vague ideas related to your ideas? (It  could go this direction... I am not sure about X, and I don't know how I might deal with Y). </b> <br>
        One challenge is representing the emotional or cultural value of clothing, which goes beyond measurable data. How do you visualize the sentimental worth of a jacket passed between friends, or a shirt turned into an art project? Another concern is ensuring that gamified features feel meaningful rather than superficial. There’s also an open question about the balance between physical and digital fashion—could digital garments or blockchain tags add value, or would they complicate the experience? I’m still exploring how to keep the system localized, accessible, and grounded in real-world action. </p>
