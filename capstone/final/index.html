      <!-- Production & Labor Conditions -->
      <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>TOTALLY ETHICALLY SOURCED</h3>
        <p>
          This coat is manufactured in factories across China, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Workers often earn as little as <strong>$68/month</strong>‚Äîabout <strong>$2.27/day</strong>‚Äîwhile working <strong>14‚Äì16 hour shifts</strong> in poorly ventilated conditions, exposed to harmful chemicals and unsafe environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the massive profits of the fashion industry, <strong>less than 2% of garment workers worldwide earn a living wage</strong>.

        <h3>HIGHEST QUALITY MATERIALS GUARANTEED</h3>
        <canvas id="materialsChart"></canvas>
        <p>
          This faux fur coat is made from a synthetic blend of <strong>85% polyester</strong>, <strong>10% acrylic</strong>, and <strong>5% other synthetics</strong>‚Äîall derived from petroleum.
          These fabrics are <strong>non-biodegradable</strong> and shed up to <strong>700,000 microplastic fibers</strong> per wash cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chemical treatments include <strong>formaldehyde-based resins</strong>, <strong>azo dyes</strong>, and <strong>flame retardants</strong>‚Äîlinked to skin irritation, respiratory issues, and long-term health risks.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Textile dyeing is the second-largest water polluter globally.</strong></p>

        <h3>A LASTING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT!</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Production consumes over <strong>2,000 liters of water</strong> (equivalent to 3 years of drinking water)</li>
          <li>Generates <strong>15.2 kg of CO‚ÇÇ emissions</strong> (similar to driving 68 km)</li>
          <li>Shipped 8,500 miles by cargo ship and truck, adding <strong>5.2 kg of CO‚ÇÇ</strong> per garment</li>
          <li><strong>92 million tons</strong> of textile waste are generated annually</li>

      <!-- Fast Fashion vs Sustainable Fashion -->
      <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>FAST FASHION VS SUSTAINABLE FASHION</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast fashion</strong> focuses on rapidly producing low-cost clothing that mimics current trends. It relies on cheap labor, synthetic materials, and mass production, often at the expense of environmental and human rights. These items are typically worn only a few times before being discarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, <strong>sustainable fashion</strong> emphasizes ethical labor practices, eco-friendly materials, and long-lasting designs. Brands in this category prioritize transparency, fair wages, low carbon emissions, and minimal waste.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fast Fashion Examples:</strong> <a href="https://www.shein.com" target="_blank">SHEIN</a>, <a href="https://www.zara.com" target="_blank">Zara</a>, <a href="https://www.hollisterco.com" target="_blank">Hollister</a></li>
          <li><strong>Sustainable Fashion Examples:</strong> <a href="https://www.patagonia.com" target="_blank">Patagonia</a>, <a href="https://www.everlane.com" target="_blank">Everlane</a>, <a href="https://www.thereformation.com" target="_blank">Reformation</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Understanding these differences can empower you to make more conscious decisions that align with your values‚Äîand help reduce the harm caused by the fashion industry.

      <!-- Research Findings Summary -->
      <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h3>üìä USER RESEARCH FINDINGS (n = 12)</h3>
        <p>
          My usability and survey research revealed important insights into how everyday consumers perceive and engage with sustainable fashion.
        </p>

        <h4>Awareness & Understanding</h4>
        <p>
          While <strong>83%</strong> of users associated sustainable fashion with environmental and ethical values, <strong>42%</strong> admitted they were unsure what actually qualifies as ‚Äúsustainable.‚Äù This gap reflects a need for clearer definitions and better education on what sustainability truly entails.
        </p>

        <h4>Willingness to Pay</h4>
        <div style="width: 300px; margin: 0 auto;">
          <canvas id="payChart"></canvas>
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>75%</strong> of participants were open to paying more for a sustainably made $30 shirt. 
          Of those, most were willing to pay between <strong>$1‚Äì$10 extra</strong>, citing <strong>better quality (83%)</strong> and <strong>ethical labor (58%)</strong> as key justifications.
        </p>

        <h4>Shopping Priorities</h4>
        <p>
          The most important factors when shopping were:
          <strong>Affordability (83%)</strong>, <strong>Quality (75%)</strong>, and <strong>Style/Trendiness (58%)</strong>.
          Despite good intentions, <strong>58%</strong> primarily shopped fast fashion, and only <strong>17%</strong> actively prioritized sustainable brands.
        </p>

        <h4>Spending Behavior</h4>
        <p>
          Most users (<strong>67%</strong>) only considered sustainability <em>sometimes</em> while shopping. While <strong>83%</strong> said they would avoid unethical brands, this behavior was mostly <em>reactive</em> ‚Äî prompted by exposure rather than proactive habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, <strong>50%</strong> reported trying to balance price and quality, and <strong>33%</strong> admitted to impulse buying when presented with sales or trendy items.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          These findings were gathered through user interviews and online surveys conducted with 12 participants as part of a capstone research study on fast fashion behavior and perception.
